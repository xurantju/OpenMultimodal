# OpenMultimodal
A lib that implements state-of-the-art or recent multi-modal algorithms with pytorch, and benchmark them as complete as possible.

The codebase contains general data loader and train/validation framework (hopefully mostly utilizing pytorch) and recent multi-modal algorithms.

The topics include:
1. image captioning
2. visual question answering
3. visual dialog
4. video-language modeling
5. joint embedding
etc

The models include:
1. CNN
2. RNN/LSTM and variants
3. attention models
4. memory networks
5. generative models (GAN/VAE)
6. Deep Reinforcement Learning
7. domain adaptation / transfer learning
8. metric learning / triplet / W-distance
etc
